Hello! I'm Ritwik and this is where I post my thoughts and things about my life. I'm currently a Machine Learning Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Insitute, part of a neat little group called the Emerging Technologies Center. I'm generally a generalist, with deep focuses into machine learning and health, which are two of my passions. Though, I find myself comfortable in any situation where hard computation problems need to be solved.

Feel free to poke around the site and hopefully you find something thought provoking. If you're going to be stopping by CMU at some point, please reach out if you want a tour or just want to chat!
